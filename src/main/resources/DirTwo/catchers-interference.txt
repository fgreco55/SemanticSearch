Catcher’s interference is one of the less common rules in baseball, but it’s important. It happens when the catcher physically hinders the batter’s attempt to hit the ball.

How It Happens
* Most often, the catcher’s mitt makes contact with the bat during the batter’s swing.

* It can also occur if the catcher steps in front of the plate or otherwise obstructs the batter’s ability to hit the pitch.

What the Rule Says
   * If catcher’s interference is called, the batter is awarded first base.

   * Any runners on base advance if they are forced to (e.g., if a runner is on first, he goes to second).

   * If the batter hits the ball and reaches first safely, and all other runners advance at least one base, the interference is ignored (the offensive team can choose to take the result of the play instead of the penalty).

Why It Exists
The rule ensures the batter gets a fair chance to swing at the pitch without being obstructed by the catcher. It prevents catchers from playing too close to the plate or trying to disrupt the batter’s swing.

Example: Bases empty, 2 outs. The batter swings, and the catcher’s glove is hit by the bat. The umpire calls “catcher’s interference,” the batter is awarded first base, and the inning continues.

Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players, often considered Americaâ€™s pastime. The game is played on a large field with four bases arranged in a diamond: first base, second base, third base, and home plate. One team plays offense (batting), aiming to score runs, while the other plays defense (fielding), trying to prevent scoring by getting players out.

The game consists of nine innings, and each inning has two halves. In the top half, the visiting team bats while the home team fields. In the bottom half, the roles reverse. Each team continues batting until three outs are made, after which the sides switch. The team with the most runs after nine innings wins the game. If the score is tied, the game may go into extra innings.

A play begins when the pitcher throws the ball toward the batter, who tries to hit it into fair territory. If successful, the batter becomes a runner and tries to reach first base, then advance around the bases to home plate. A run is scored when a player completes this circuit.

The defense uses a variety of strategies and skills to record outs. Common ways to get outs include strikeouts (the batter fails to hit three pitches), flyouts (a fielder catches the ball in the air), and force outs or tag outs (fielders get the ball to a base or tag a runner before they arrive).

Baseball requires a blend of individual skill and team coordination. Pitchers and batters often face a chess match of strategy and anticipation, while fielders must work together to cover ground and execute plays. The balance of offense and defense, along with the game's rich history and deep statistical tradition, has made baseball a uniquely enduring and strategic sport enjoyed by millions around the world.
